        * Add is_refref() function!
        * Mention and compare to Scalar::Util::reftype.
        * Add benchmark results, including against reftype.
        * Add a note about the nature of playing with op trees, sort of.
        * Add a note on what functions from reftype() are not available.
        * Clarify how bad overloading is. No, it's not duck-typing either.
